# 3d
babylon blender

- these are some work in progress 3d animations
- to run you need node.js
- from the terminal in the directory type node server.js
-  the animation will appear on localhost 5000
- they may take a minute or two to come up, not much optimization has been done yet
- you will need to npm express, since currently the package.json file doesn't include that, will be fixed at some point
